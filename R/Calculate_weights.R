#' Calculate inverse probability of selection weights.
#'
#' @description
#' This function calculates weights to correct for ascertainment bias in
#' time-to-event data where clusters are outcome-dependently sampled,
#' for example high-risk families in genetic epidemiological studies in
#' cancer research.
#'
#' @details
#' Weights are based on a comparison between the survival between sample and
#' population. Therefore, besides the sample data, the population incidence rate
#' (per 100 000) is needed as input, as well as the cut-offs of the
#' (age/time-to-event) groups for which this is available. The function provides
#' two options for the latter: cut-offs can be provided manually or using the
#' standard 5- or 10-years (age) categories (0-4, 5-9, ... or 0-9, 10-14, ...).
#' Note that resulting intervals are of the form [xx, xx).

Calculate_weights <- function(dat){

### Input:

#' @param dat Data.frame with one row per individual with columns *d*
#' non-censoring indicator; **k** interval of (age) group; **S_k**
#' population interval-based proportion of individuals experiencing the
#' event in intervals later than k; **S_k.** sample
#' proportion of individuals experiencing the event in intervals later
#' than k.

### Output:

#' @return Vector with weights.

  # --------------- Extract variables from input data.frame.

  # Group/interval.
  k <- dat$k

  # Population proportion of individuals experiencing the event in intervals
  # later than k.
  S_k <- dat$S_k

  # Sample proportion of individuals experiencing the event in intervals
  # later than k.
  S_k. <- dat$S_k.

  # --------------- Create empty containers.

  v <- w <- rep(NA, nrow(dat))

  # --------------- Calculate the weights.

  for (n in 1:nrow(dat)){

    # Weights for unaffected.
    v[n] = 1

    # Weights for cases.
    w[n] = ( (1 - S_k[n]) / S_k[n] ) * (S_k.[n] / ( 1 - S_k.[n]))
  }

  merged <- cbind(dat, w, v)
  merged$weight <- NA

  # --------------- Assign w for uncensored, v for censored (interval-wise).

  merged$weight[which(merged$d == 1)] <- merged$w[which(merged$d == 1)]
  merged$weight[which(merged$d == 0)] <- merged$v[which(merged$d == 0)]

  merged$w <- merged$v <- NULL  # Remove old variable.

  # --------------- Collect output.

  vec_weights <- merged$weight

  # If weight is 0, add very small value (coxph does not accept weights of 0).
  vec_weights[which(vec_weights==0)] <- 0.0000001

  # --------------- Print warning if weights are invalid.

  ifelse((sum(vec_weights<0)>0), print("Invalid (negative) weights!"),
         print("No negative weights"))

  # --------------- Return output.

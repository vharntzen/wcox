This package allows the user to calculate time-dependent weights to correct for ascertainment bias in a specific situation: outcome dependently sampled (family) data ('weighted cohort approach').
Weights can be included in a Cox proportional hazard model to obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of a (continuous) risk modifier on time-to-event.
More details will be available soon, when the corresponding paper -currently under submission- is published in a journal.

'twcox' has the following functionalities.
- Prepare data for weight calculation. Input is a wide format (one row per individual) sample data set and the population incidence per age group.
- Calculate weights.
- A tutorial describing the analysis steps one-by-one.

Install the package as follows:

require(devtools)
install_github("vharntzen/twcox")

The tutorial can be found running vignette("twcox").
